The dataset presented here (the ELLIPSE corpus) comprises argumentative essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs). The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions.

Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure. The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5.
