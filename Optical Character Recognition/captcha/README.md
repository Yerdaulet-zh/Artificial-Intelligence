Optical character recognition is one of the exciting areas of computer vision that makes our lives easier and saves time by automating work in various areas of life.

For demonstration purposes, I created an architecture through the PyTorch library using components such as CNN and GRU to solve the captcha dataset problem.

Captcha Dataset contains more than 113,000 colorful 5-character images.
